# SIOCtl
Simple IOCTL dispatcher
<br>
This is a generic IOCTL "dispatcher". I made this to be used as a POC for CVE 2018-8060 and 2018-8061.<br>
   It can be used to any device, IOCTL and data, thought.<br>
   Input data is a binary file, containing raw data to be used as input buffer in IO control.<br>
   Output data is displayed as hexdecimal dump.<br>
